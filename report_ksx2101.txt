All 5 corpus sentences generate correctly.

q1_ksx2101.txt contains 1000 randomly generated sentences. I used the loop-run function that was 
emailed to us to output the sentences to the file. Valid sentences are prefixed with a "+", 
while sentences that have been rejected by validp are prefixed with a "-".

I have 5 helper functions for validp. check-length, check-depth, check-for-repeats,
check-repeated-subordinating-conjunction, and check-coordinating-conjunction-count all return 
true if the sentence is not rejected. validp simply ANDs together all these results, so if validp 
returns true, then the sentence is valid.

check-length - checks if sentence is 40 words or less
check-depth - should check if the tree depth is 10 or less. I couldn't figure it out in time
	so check-depth just always returns true
checks-for-repeats - checks that no words are repeated, BUT CERTAIN TYPES OF WORDS ARE ALLOWED
	TO BE REPEATED SUCH AS prepositions, articles, etc.
check-repeated-subordinating-conjunction - checks that subordinating conjunctions never appear 
twice in a row in the sentence
check-coordinating-conjunction-count - checks if there are less than 8 coordinating conjunctions
	in the sentence (ex. and, but)

generateValid returns a valid phrase described by the non_term input. Ex. if you
call generateValid('sentence), the function will generate a random sentence and check 
if it's valid using validp. If it's valid, then the sentence will be returned. If not,
the function will keep calling random-sentence until a valid sentence is returned.


*** My grammar handles singular/plural noun phrases, present/past tense verbs, transitive/
	intransitive verbs. I handled most cases, though not all because the number of rules would
	be growing exponentially!

	I make use of recursion (ex. sentence -> sentence and sentence) as well as
	rules for optional part of speech (ex. NounPhraseSingular -> (Abstract Noun) (Abstract Noun 
	Prep Phrase)). I added many pre-terminal symbols to make my grammar more sophisticated (ex.
	Abstract Noun, RelativePronoun, InfinitiveVerb, HelpingVerb, LinkingVerb, Expletive, 
	InfinitiveParticle) along with the advanced terminal symbols.

****** My Grammar, New Symbols, New Production Rules


Sentence: 

- I added more complex sentence structures.
- (NounPhraseSingular VerbPhraseSingularPresent) - A NounPhrase can be singular or plural. A verb
	phrase can be singular or plural, and present or past. Example of this: "The happy boy talks
	to his mother."
- (ExpletivePhrase NounPhrasePlural) - An ExpletivePhrase is needed to handle the "There were..."
	in sentence 3. An ExpletivePhrase consists of an Expletive + BeingVerb. Example: "There were
	many children in the park."
- (Sentence CoordinatingConjunction Sentence) - This is needed so two sentences can be joined by
	an "and", "but", etc. Example: "I like to run in the park and I like to go to the gym."
- (SubordinatingConjunction Sentence VerbPhraseFuturePerfect) - This is needed to handle sentence
	5. A subordinating conjunction joins a main caluse and a dependent clause. Ex. "Whether my
	friend passed his test is not known yet."
- (NounPhrasePlural VerbPhrasePluralPresent) - This is the same as the first sentence rule, 
	except it's for plural noun phrases. Ex. "My brothers swim in the lake."
- (NounPhraseSingular VerbPhraseSingularPast)) - Same as first sentence rule, except it's for past
	tense. "My sister baked me a cake."

NounPhraseSingular:

- This is for noun phrases that are singular.
- (Article NounSingular) - ex. "The house"
- (Article AdjectivePhrase NounSingular) - ex. "The red house"
- (AbstractNoun) - It is a noun that a person can't physically interact with. Ex. "education"
- (AdjectivePhrase AbstractNoun) - Ex. "Higher education"
- (NounPhraseSingular PrepPhrase) - Ex. "house across the street"
- (AttributiveNoun AbstractNoun) - An attributive noun is a noun that describes another noun. Ex.
	"Health care" (health is an attributive noun)
- (Article AttributiveNoun NounSingular)) - Ex. "The government agency"

NounPhrasePlural:

- This is for noun phrases that are plural.
- (AdjectivePhrase NounPlural) - ex. "Yellow and brown bananas"
- (NounPhrasePlural PrepPhrase) - ex. "bananas in the basket"
- (AdjectivePhrase NounPhrasePlural PrepPhrase) ex. "Yellow and brown bananas in the basket"
- (NounPhrasePlural RelativeClause) - A relative clause is like an adjective clause- it gives more
	information about a noun. Ex. "bananas that went bad"
- (NounPlural) - Ex. "Bananas"
- (NounPhrasePlural CoordinatingConjunction NounPhraseSingular) - Ex. "Bananas and a kiwi"
- (AdjectivePhrase AttributiveNoun NounPlural) Ex. "Great health services"
- (Article AdjectivePhrase NounPlural)) Ex. "The healthy boys"

VerbPhraseSingularPast:

- This is a past tense verb phrase that matches a singular noun-phrase.
- (IntransitiveVerbPast) - An intransitive verb is one that can stand on its own without a direct
	object. Ex. "I laughed" uses a past tense IV
- (IntransitiveVerbPast PrepPhrase) - An IV can be followed by a prep phrase 
- (TransitiveVerbPast NounPhraseSingular) - A transitive verb needs a direct object, which is why
	it's followed by a NounPhraseSingular. Ex - "broke the vase"
- (TransitiveVerbPast NounPhraseSingular PrepPhrase - Same as last one, except it has a 
	prepositional phrase option

VerbPhraseSingularPresent:

- A present tense verb phrase that matches a singular noun-phrase.
- (HelpingVerb InfinitiveVerb NounPhraseSingular). A helping verb helps out the main verb in a 
	sentence. An InfinitiveVerb is a verb in its most basic form. Ex. "should bake cookies"
- (HelpingVerb Adverb InfinitiveVerb NounPhraseSingular) - This is the same as the previous one 
	except it has an option adverb. "should happily bake cookies"
- (HelpingVerb Adverb LinkingVerb Adjective PrepPhrase) - This links a noun-phrase to an 
	adjective using a helping verb and linking verb. The adverb and prep-phrase are just more
	advanced options that build off this sentence structure. ex. "He should be happy",
	"He should really be happy at the park"
- (IntransitiveVerbSingularPresent) - This is a present tense IV that follows a singular noun
	phrase. Ex. "He laughs"
- (IntransitiveVerbSingularPresent PrepPhrase) - Same as previous one, just adds an optional
	prep phrase. Ex. "He laughs at the joke"
- (TransitiveVerbSingularPresent NounPhraseSingular) - ex. "counters the attack"
- (TransitiveVerbSingularPresent NounPhraseSingular PrepPhrase) - Same as previous one, just
	adds an optional prep-phrase. Ex. "counters the attack in the park"


VerbPhraseFuturePerfect:

- This is a verb phrase that is in future perfect tense.
- I only included one case for this because it was only needed for sentence 5. Otherwise, there
	would be an exponentially growing number of sentences.
- (HelpingVerb LinkingVerb IntransitiveVerbPast PrepPhrase)) - Past tense IV verbs are the same
	for singular and plural noun phrases, so there is only one category of IntransitiveVerbPast.
	Ex. "will be decided in a few weeks"

VerbPhrasePluralPresent:

- A present tense verb phrase that matches a plural noun-phrase.
- I only included one case of this.
- (HelpingVerb LinkingVerb Adjective InfinitivePhrase) - I'll define the infinitive phrase 
	below. Ex. "should be able to see it"

ExpletivePhrase: 

-Expletives are words or phrases that do not add any structural or grammatical 
	meaning to the sentence. It's used in sentence 3.
- (Expletive BeingVerb) - "There were"

AdjectivePhrase:

- You can have multiple adjectives, so they're implemented with recursion.
- (Adjective) - "happy"
- (Adjective AdjectivePhrase) "big happy"
- (Adjective CoordinatingConjunction AdjectivePhrase) - "big and happy" 

PrepPhrase: 

- A prepositional phrase will begin with a preposition and end with a noun, pronoun, gerund,
	or clause. I only needed to use the noun/noun-phrase.
- (Preposition NounPhraseSingular) - "at the park"
- (Preposition NounPhrasePlural) - "near the buildings"
- (Determiner Preposition NounPhrasePlural) - "such as business services"

RelativeClause:

- A relative clause is like an adjective clause- it gives more information about a noun.
- I only had one type of relative clause because it's all I needed.
- (RelativePronoun IntransitiveVerbPluralPresent InfinitivePhrase) - ex. "that tend to 
	pay well" 

InfinitivePhrase:

- Consists of "to" + InfinitiveVerb (simplest form of a verb)
- (InfinitiveParticle InfinitiveVerb Adverb) - ex. "to pay well"
- (InfinitiveParticle InfinitiveVerb PersonalPronoun PrepPhrase) - ex. "to see it with 
	telescopes"
